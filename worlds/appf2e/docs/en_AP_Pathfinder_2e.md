## What is AP Pathfinder 2e

The randomizer creates a dungeon with an arbitrary number of rooms, some of which are locked by one of an arbitrary 
number of keys, each of which contains five locations blocked by winning a randomly generated 
encounter (this part is done manually using a VTT or another method; creating a PF2e simulator is way out of scope for 
this project). The final room contains a boss encounter, the completion of which is the goal of the game.

The player starts with four random Ancestries, Backgrounds, and Classes that they combine to create their party of four 
characters. They also start with four random weapons, four random armours, and an arbitrary number of random shields. 
Their characters start at an arbitrary level and can level up by receiving "Level Up" items, up to an arbitrary maximum 
level. Logic requires that the characters are of at least a certain level and have all level-appropriate weapon and 
armour runes to complete any given room in the dungeon. Characters restore all HP, Focus Points, and abilities with a 
cooldown of an hour or less, along with succeeding at repairing any equipment after each encounter. Depending on 
settings, characters can be using exploration activities at the start of combat if they have them unlocked.
